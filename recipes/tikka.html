        <p><strong>This Chicken Tikka Masala is spicy, creamy, flavorful and crazy delicious!</strong> You won’t want to stop with one serving!<br> Make this better than restaurant Chicken tikka masala at home with my easy time-tested recipe. I also share plenty of options<br> to grill the chicken – in Oven, air fryer, on a griddle or skillet. Cooking this flavor-packed curry is easier than you think.<br> Serve it over basmati rice, Cumin Rice or with Butter Naan, Roti, Chapati, Paratha or any flatbread of choice.</p>
